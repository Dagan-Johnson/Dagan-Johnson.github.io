                <p>Project Description:For this project we were tasked with creating two tracks each a minute long  that would portrat what Life on earth was like.For this recording I wanted to record the standard two types of places that most people think of:
urban and rural. However, I wanted to slowly phase in more and more sound effects associated
with those places to show that there are a number of unique sounds that create a single place,
but they all come from individual sources. As the base for the rural track I decided to go with
wind whistling in the air as it's just something most people would think of. For the City, I thought
a low eerie hum of electricity would be the most accurate to include for someone visiting earth
for the first time as electricity moving does make a noise, we just don’t consciously hear it.
Ultimately I decided that people’s voices should be present in both, but only at the very end as I
don’t think that people are what distinguish these two places. Although in a larger scale, cities
are cities because there are people there, I feel the noises that create the aesthetic that is cities
are mostly non-organic, which is of course in contrast with rural areas. Also this took me an
insane amount of time to find sound effects that I actually liked. The album cover is the album
cover because it's the epitome of human creation.</p>
