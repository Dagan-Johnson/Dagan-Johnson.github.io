                <p>Project Description: For this project we were tasked with just using Photoshop to create a collage using multiple landscapes as well as plant and animal life. I started this image with the mountains
                    in the background and noticed that the way one of the mountains curved looked similar to a neck, thus the peacock. After that I knew I wanted to incorporate peackock colors in some way, but in a disjointed manor
                    which led me using the tail overlayed in the water. In a broader sense the flowers and peackock and mountins are all examples of the inherrant beauty of creation.
