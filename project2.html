                <p>Project Description: For this project we were tasked with utilizing Illustrator to create a pattern. I knew in the beginning that I wanted to make
                an off kilter pattern, or something that would less neat. After creating the basic outline I though it looked in some way similar to the recent images 
                of the biblically accurate angel that people have been creating. Angels are repeated throughout the bible in many forms and descriptions and are often
                idolized in contemporary writings. Despite this I feel that angels, upon inspection of actions are not just extremly offputting, but basicly commit 
                what today we would consider to be rape. Although accounts differ, I think its pretty agreed upon that Mary was young, and here we have a young woman who
                is being told by an indescribable power that she needs to bear the child of an godly being with no emphasis on consent, it's her duty so to speak. 
                Sounds like a power dynamic with rape to me. Thus, the perversion of the classic "be not afraid" and the offsetting color pallete.</p>
