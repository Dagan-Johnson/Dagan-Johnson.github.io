                <p>Project Description:For this project we were tasked with finding any image online and using a hex editor to see the 
                    hex values associated with the image and modifying those values. I chose to use a picture of a train station and edit 
                    it by interspercidly pasting passages from Frankenstein by Mary Shelly. I wanted to draw attention to how trains are a great answer 
                    to modern transportation issues, but as they have been neglected have become unrecognizable. The key of glitch art is distorting technology 
                    and Frankenstein's Monster, trains, and the image I posted are all technologies which have been askew. Although I made the image before the recent
                    train derailments I find it ironic that both Frankenstein's monster and mis-treated trains have resulted in the deaths of innocent people.
